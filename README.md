# Discord Bots Homepage

Welcome to the homepage for my Discord bots!  
This site serves as a central hub to check the status, repositories, and updates for all the bots I've created.

## What is this?

This is a simple GitHub Pages site that lists all my Discord bots, with links to their repositories and basic status info.  
It's not a template or a framework—just a homepage for my projects.
